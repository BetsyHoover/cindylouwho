			<h3> Welcome to my site! </h3>
			<p>Thanks for coming!  Its great to see you.  There is a conversation happening in the women's movement today that says women simply can't have it all.  It is too difficult to ballance a career and a family and everything else life throws at us.  So women today have to choose.</p>
			<p> I am here to tell you that is not the case.  If women make te choices they believe are right for them and their family, they can find a way to be truly happy and satisfied while constantly reaching for more.</p>
			<p>My goal is to inspire other women like me to take a stand against this attitude.  We accept the challenge at hand and seek to constantly be better. I hope you will join me in this fight!
